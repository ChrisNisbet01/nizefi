when calculating time to rotate an angle we do this


v2 ^ 2 = v1 ^ 2 + 2 * a * s

where 
v2: final velocity
v1: initial velocity
a: acceleration
s: distance

final velocity v2 is therefore sqrt((v1 ^ 2) + (2 * a * s))

if we want to work out time to travel a distance we can take
(v2 - v1) / 2 to get average velocity v(avg)
 
then t = d / v(avg)

obviously, if v(avg) is zero, this doesn't work.
